# Changelog

All notable changes to Mudrik are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Contact / About section in README (GitHub, X, LinkedIn, email)
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1)
- This `CHANGELOG.md`

### Changed
- README trimmed and restructured for open-source launch
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` now owns the full Develop + Release pipeline sections

### Removed
- `telemetryEnabled` config field (never wired; removing the placeholder)
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` from the public repo (internal planning lives elsewhere)

## [1.0.0] — rebrand

### Changed
- HoverBuddy → **Mudrik** (مدرك — Arabic for "perceiver"). User-facing strings, installer artifacts, and config paths migrated. Repo folder stays `hoverbuddy/` for compatibility.
- On-disk config path `%APPDATA%\hoverbuddy\` → `%APPDATA%\mudrik\`, with one-shot migration on first launch.
- Refined owl mascot: steel-blue palette, layered wings, golden eyes, curved ear tufts, circle-shaped blink.

### Added
- Retry button on response errors (`lastPromptRef` captures the last prompt).
- `actionsEnabled` master toggle (replaces `autoClickGuide`). Snapshotted at session start; system prompt advises the user to start a new conversation to change it mid-flow.
- Send button with up-arrow icon in the chat input.
- Option to disable chat-session restoration on popup.

### Fixed
- `robot.keyTap("v", ["control"])` broken on robotjs 0.7.0 — replaced with explicit keyToggle chord + PowerShell fallback.
- Copy-chip state keyed per-chip so duplicate text doesn't toggle every chip.
- Settings dropdown is scrollable and never exceeds panel height.
- Session-history replay preserves `<!--ACTION:...-->` markers (renderer hides them visually).
- Area-capture DPI mismatch (DIPs → physical pixels via `display.scaleFactor`).
- First-activation context-drop race (preload-level buffer replays `CONTEXT_READY`).
- Stale previous-context bug (monotonic `activationSeq` drops superseded reads).
- Auto-screenshot on Alt+Space removed — manual 📸 button only.
